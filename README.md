# RFID-attendance-
Smart IOT based RFID attendance login automation project

it was a burden for evering faculties and students to maintain their login credential and data entry in the attendance to update their presence and absence everyday to their respect to departments and administration of their colleges

due to the uneven formalities in data entry maintenance and login credential updates the institutions and their respected departments get lack of performance in the different expect which causes the unfilled gap in the working days 

so this was the major problem statement which has became a basement to our project which we use to work from scratch to the final automation end.

so I made this most fascinating and emerging project which is based on radio frequency network and high data connectivity and update system which is called as smart iot based RF ID attendance system using the robotics and embedded system which is interconnected with the automation and electronics which is integrated with the microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP 32
