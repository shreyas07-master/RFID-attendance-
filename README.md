# RFID-attendance-
Smart IOT based RFID attendance login automation project

It was a burden for evering faculties and students to maintain their login credential & data entry in the attendance to update their presence & absence everyday to their respect to departments & administration of their colleges


Due to the uneven formalities in data entry maintenance and login credential updates the institutions and their respected departments get lack of performance in the different aspect which causes the unfilled gap in the working days 


So this was the major problem statement which has became a basement to our project which we use to work from scratch to the final automation end.


So I made this most fascinating and emerging project which is based on radio frequency network and high data connectivity and update system which is called as smart iot based RF ID attendance system using the robotics and embedded system which is interconnected with the automation and electronics which is integrated with the microcontrollers like Arduino & ESP 32

Just buy tapping a given RFID ID and tag to the radio frequency module the data of the particular student or faculties or workers or employees will be automatically noted and saved in attendance maintenance document and automatically saved and updated to the respective sector and institution

The person who tapped their particulat RFID card or tag, their logic credentials which directly analysed and saved in the daily login data entry and attendance book
